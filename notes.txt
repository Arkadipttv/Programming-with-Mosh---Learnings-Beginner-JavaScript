Q1. Why is it better to add <script> section in the body rather than head section?

A. Browser generally parses from top to bottom. So if while parsing the HTML file it finds a lot of javascript code written in the head section, then it will take a lot of time to load. So its better to write it in the body section.

Q2. console.log("Hello World");

A. It is a statement that means "we want to log(keep track of) a message "Hello World" into the console"

Q3. Javascript in Node -- Node is a runtime environment to execute JS code

$ node .\index.js

A. V8 is the JavaScript engine that powers Node.js. It's also used in Google Chrome and desktop apps like Electron. V8 is written in C++ by Google and is available on systems that use x64, IA-32, and ARM processors. It can run on Mac, Windows, Linux, and other systems, and can also be embedded into any C++ application. 

Q4. What is V8?

A. V8 is open-source and high-performance. It translates JavaScript code into machine code, which computers can understand, and then executes the compiled code. V8 also optimizes JavaScript execution. 

V8 was chosen to power Node.js in 2009, and is now a key feature that powers a large amount of server-side code written in JavaScript. The current Node.js engine can't work without V8, as it would have no JavaScript engine and wouldn't be able to run JavaScript code. 


Q5. ES6 -- var

 Q7. Types in JavaScript

 A. Primitive/ Value Types and Reference Types
    Under Primitive we have --
    1. String
    2. Number
    3. Boolean
    4. undefined
    5. null

    Reference Types --
    1. Objects
    2. Arrays
    3. Functions

Q8. Languages

A. Two types:
    1. Static(Statically-typed)
        one whose data type cannot be changed during runtime.
        EX: string name = "Arka";
    2. Dynamic(Dynamically-Typed)
        one whose data type can be changed at runtime.  
        EX: let name = "Arka";
    
    So, JS is a Dynamic Language.
